## Essence

> [Network Security](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24783/network-security) is an over-arching term that describes the policies and procedures implemented by a network administrator
> to avoid and keep track of unauthorized access, exploitation, modification, or denial of the network and network resources.
> This means that a well-implemented network security blocks viruses, malware, hackers, etc. from accessing or altering secure
> information.
